-- Export all the notes from Notes.app into a folder as HTML text.
-- A very basic backup script.
--
-- Usage:
--  * Open this file in Script Editor
--  * Run
--  * Select a folder to export files to
--
-- Output:
--  * A collection of (Latin-1 encoded) HTML files
--  * A list of attachment names for each note.
--
-- Known issues:
--  * Only the names of attachments are exported, not the files
--    themselves.  (Look for the files in
--    ~Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/Media).
--  * Some attachment types (e.g. app links) show up as "Missing value"
--  * Some formatting is lost.
--  * A note with the same title as a previously exported note will be
--    overwritten.
--  * It will exported notes in the "Recently Deleted" folder which
--    haven't been purged from disk yet.
